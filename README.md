- 👋 Hi, I’m John Carry, also known as a woodworker I have been a professional saw expert for over 10 years. I’d work with every type of saw machine out there, and experiment to find which tools work better.
- 👀 I’m always looking for ways to improve my skills and help those around me. I love my job and am always happy to share my knowledge with others.

- 💞️ if you’re a seasonal woodworker who just needs some inspiration, or if you don’t do this type of work before no worries, I’m here to help you every step to step how to do it.
- 📫 have questions about my work or do you want to need some advice on how to do your next project successfully?

Don’t hesitate to contact me with ideas, suggestions, and any help.

Thanks,

John Carry
